## About me 

A seasoned civil engineer with 5.5 years of experience, I'm embarking on an exciting journey into the realm of data science and machine learning. My professional background includes managing a consultancy specializing in road and building construction estimation, serving various government bodies in Gujarat, India.

In addition to my engineering ventures, I've delved into entrepreneurship, overseeing the import-export business of Bleaching Powder to Bangladesh, as well as FMCG toiletry products production in Jamnagar, Gujarat. Not one to shy away from opportunities, I've also ventured into supplying branded spices to Bangladesh.

Driven by a fascination for generating investment opportunities, I've immersed myself in the world of the stock market. Through the highs and lows of the beginner's cycle, I've honed my skills in transforming strategies into algorithms to identify lucrative trading and investment prospects.

I'm currently on an enriching learning journey, aspiring to master data science and machine learning through reputable platforms like Scaler (InterviewBit Technologies Private Limited), 123 of AI [Alpha ML], and Trainity, where I'm engaged in diverse projects spanning data analytics and visualization.
